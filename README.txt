uBuddy

A mental health Amazon Alexa app that helps users work through difficult times in the moment by guiding them through meditation, as well as helps users remember whether they took their medications.


Our team wanted to develop some app to help people through difficult times, especially through mental illness. It's difficult in the moment of a panic attack to feel better or like yourself.

We found this project challeging as we learned Alexa from scratch for the first time. It was a fun challenge, and we're proud of what we've created in a short time.
